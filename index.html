    Meaningful Data - Chapter 6
    </h1>
    <p>
    In Chapter 6, Cairo talks about how interesting stories can arise from both norm and exceptions. Cairo doesn't explicitly define what is counted as a norm, but from my understanding, it is something like basic statistical measure, like the mode, median,the mean, standard deviation, etc.. Those are sounded tedious, but in fact quite useful in terms of providing a foudation for us to analyze the data. Those foundations can help us tell a better story</p>
    <p>
    Once we have the foundation, exceptions help make the story more attracting. The exceptions are something exclusive to the norm, such as outlier, or just something different. The example in the book is about how Michael Jordan affected the starting salaries of people graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His salaries drew the number to an unexpectly high level. This is a story that we cannot tell if simply just looking at the norm. Although Cairo doesn't define the exception, I believe it is something extra to help us understand the data. </p>
    <p>
    One of my own examples is a dataset I use for my Economic Growth class to analyze the growth of GDP per capita.I have two graphs below, name which one tells a better story.</p>
    <figure class="no">
    <img src="GDP.jpg">
    <figcaption> This one is not good. Although it shows the overall trend of the GDP Per Capita, it tells you nothing else. </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="yes">
    <img src="onratio.jpg">
            <figcaption> This one is better because audience can not only see the trend, but also can figure out the growth rate by comparing the slope to the blue line as it is in a ratio (logarithmic scale). So, this one tells a better story.</figcaption>
